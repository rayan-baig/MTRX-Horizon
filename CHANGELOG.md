# What changed

The newest version is at the top. The number in `VERSION` is shown at the
bottom of the home page and the console, and by `/healthz`, so you can tell
which version is live.

## 1.3.0 (5 November 2026)

- **Genesis** (`/genesis`), a new feature for every visitor: turn an idea into a project with
  a name, a one-line pitch, who it's for and a web address idea, then take it from Spark to
  Plan, Build and Launch with a launch checklist in plain words, progress per stage and
  overall, and notes. Projects are cards in a list, with an empty state for the first idea.
  Linked from the home page's menu and footer, the other pages, the sitemap, and the console.
- Genesis keeps projects only in the visitor's own browser. Download and Import move them
  between devices; Delete all clears them. It still works, and says so, when the browser
  blocks storage.
- **Ask Genesis**: free, short AI help on a project (sharpen the pitch, who might use it, the
  simplest first version, name ideas, what could go wrong, what's next, or a short question),
  which can be saved to the project's notes. Off until `GENESIS_AI_KEY` and
  `GENESIS_AI_MODEL` are set. Limited per visitor (10 an hour, 30 a day, by address, no
  cookie) and by a daily spend cap (`GENESIS_AI_DAILY_CAP_USD`, 2 dollars by default). The
  idea text is passed to the AI provider and never stored or logged.
- The privacy page says what Genesis keeps (nothing on the server but counts) and what Ask
  Genesis sends.
- The home page's links close up a little on mid-sized screens so the new Genesis link fits.

## 1.2.1 (3 November 2026)

- `docs/STAGING.md`: how to run a second copy at `staging.<your domain>` on
  its own Render service and disk, with its own setup code, knock and stats
  key, mail off or to a test inbox, and a checklist for taking a tested
  commit to live. It is set up by hand, not in `render.yaml`, so syncing
  the live Blueprint never touches it.
- `MTRX_NOINDEX=1`, for that copy only: every answer says noindex,
  robots.txt closes the site and the sitemap is empty. Unset, nothing
  changes. Leave it unset on live.

## 1.2.0 (3 November 2026)

- When the site hits an error it did not expect, you get a short email (at
  the same address as the "app is down" alerts) with nothing about the
  visitor in it, and the console's activity list shows it.
- A load test tool and its results (`docs/LOAD-TEST.md`).

## 1.1.0 (2 November 2026)

- The company is now spelled **MTRX Horizyn** everywhere people see it.
- A friendly page when something goes wrong on the server, instead of a bare
  error.
- Share previews (the picture and text a link shows in a chat) work from
  any app, and the public pages are listed in a sitemap for search engines.
- Console: what each month costs to run, and a link to each app's own admin
  page.
- A brand page (`/brand`) with the logos, colours and the right spelling.

## 1.0.0 (2 November 2026)

- The home page presents MTRX Horizyn as the parent company of RankUp,
  CyberLogix AI and OmniArmor.ai, with an About card, contact, privacy and
  terms.
- Console: every app's health on one screen, and an email when one stays
  down.
- The owner's console is reached by a secret knock from an approved device
  only.
